This is my emacs setup. You probably don't want to copy it, or even
read it. Some of the code in here goes back to 1993, when Emacs and I
were both quite a bit more naive, and it will be less embarassing for
everyone involved if you just pretend you didn't see this.

If you're looking for a good emacs setup, I highly, highly recommend
Phil "Technomancy" Hagelberg's emacs-starter-kit:

You'll probably learn something from reading his code (I know I
did). My codes will just make you dumber.







(Still here? Stubborn fool! Well, ok, go ahead, but don't say I didn't
warn you.)
