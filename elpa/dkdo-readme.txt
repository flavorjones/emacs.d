Do List Mode is a major mode supporting a freely editable task
list. It is based on org-mode, and org-mode features like
outlining, visibility cycling, and lists/checkboxes are used for
structuring and managing tasks. However in so far as it maintains
the Do List in a separate document and allows for continuous
re-ordering of tasks to reflect changing priorities, it provides an
alternative to org mode's TODO items feature.

It keeps urgent tasks near the top of the file to maximise
visibility and supports deferred and recurring tasks.
