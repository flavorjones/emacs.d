Here are two slightly subdued color themes that are easy on the eyes
and cover a reasonably complete set of faces.

The themes are designed for use with Emacs' built-in theme support
in Emacs 24. However, they also work with older Emacs versions, in
which case color-theme.el is required.

Usage:

If your Emacs has the `load-theme' command, you can use it to
activate one of these themes programatically, or use
`customize-themes' to select a theme interactively.

Alternatively, or in older Emacs versions, use one of the provided
wrapper commands to activate a theme:

    M-x color-theme-solarized-light
    M-x color-theme-solarized-dark
